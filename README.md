# [Rainfall Analysis Dashboard]

## Rainfall is one of the climatological data which is widely analyzed for a long time. The rainfall analysis dashboard focuses on the analysis of rainfalldata in Malaysia. In rainfall analysis dashboard can be used to study the random fluctuations in the weekly rainfall data across the districts for each state and to study weather there is climate changes in the past week. As we know, the heavy raining will lead to flash floods.From the changes of the rainfall pattern, we can get the warning for floods and can help to reduce the impacts on you and your family.

## ✨ Code-base structure

The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented bellow:

```bash

<br />

> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users

<br />

## ✨ Recompile CSS

To recompile SCSS files, follow this setup:

<br />

**Step #1** - Install tools

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.x or higher
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - globally 
    - `npm install -g gulp-cli`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional) 

<br />

**Step #2** - Change the working directory to `assets` folder

```bash
$ cd core/static/assets
```

<br />

**Step #3** - Install modules (this will create a classic `node_modules` directory)

```bash
$ npm install
// OR
$ yarn
```

<br />

**Step #4** - Edit & Recompile SCSS files 

```bash
$ gulp scss
```

The generated file is saved in `static/assets/css` directory.

<br />

## ✨ Deployment

The app is provided with a basic configuration to be executed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), and [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/).

### [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)
---

Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install gunicorn
```
> Start the app using gunicorn binary

```bash
$ gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:8001 core.wsgi:application
Serving on http://localhost:8001
```

Visit `http://localhost:8001` in your browser. The app should be up & running.


<br />

### [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/)
---

Waitress (Gunicorn equivalent for Windows) is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance. It has no dependencies except ones that live in the Python standard library.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install waitress
```
> Start the app using [waitress-serve](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/runner.html)

```bash
$ waitress-serve --port=8001 core.wsgi:application
Serving on http://localhost:8001
```

Visit `http://localhost:8001` in your browser. The app should be up & running.
